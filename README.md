# Common Utilities

This package serves as a lightweight and modular library to supply some commonly used functions that can be imported as needed. The functions chosen in here are based on my professional experience. Each of these are something I've either wrote locally in each project, or from a copy and pasted file between each project.

Each function is written in typescript, and fully unit tested. These are compiled to vanilla JavaScript. During that compilation they become namespaced with the prefix `cu_` to avoid collisions with other functions and libraries that might be in use on your project.
